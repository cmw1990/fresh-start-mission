# Mission Fresh - Current Implementation Status

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the Mission Fresh application based on the Production Readiness & Enhancement checklist.

## Core Features Status

### ✅ Implemented Features
- Basic authentication (login/register)
- Basic dashboard with key stats and widgets
- Goal setting functionality (afresh/fresher paths)
- Daily log entry for nicotine use, wellness, cravings, and journaling
- Progress visualization with charts
- Settings page with profile management
- Step rewards tracking system
- Public web tools (NRT Guide, Smokeless Directory, etc.)
- Responsive design for web and mobile views
- Basic Capacitor integration for mobile app wrapper

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented Features
- Dashboard widgets (some metrics may need dynamic calculation refinement)
- Mobile features (haptic feedback exists but native step tracking needs completion)
- Settings features (theme switching works, but notification preferences need backend)
- Progress charts (may need additional validation for sparse data cases)
- Support tools (basic UI exists but some interactive exercises may need enhancement)

### ❌ Missing Critical Features
- Success feedback toasts for user actions (especially for log entries)
- Complete native step tracking integration with health platforms
- Comprehensive form validation across all inputs
- Push notification infrastructure and user preferences
- Offline support for mobile app
- Thorough error handling throughout the app

## Technical Debt Areas
1. Some components are too large and need refactoring (e.g., Navbar.tsx at 309 lines)
2. Row Level Security policies in Supabase need review
3. Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E) needed
4. Performance optimization for mobile devices
5. Accessibility compliance needs verification

## Next Steps Priority
1. Add success feedback toasts for critical actions
2. Complete native step tracking integration
3. Implement comprehensive form validation
4. Refactor large components into smaller, focused ones
5. Enhance error handling throughout the application

This assessment is based on codebase review as of April 2025.
